Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster - Getting Started With R
================================================================
Robert Gitari 

I made 4 different models:

    Model 1: Null model
    Model 2: Gender model 
    Model 3: Classification tree 
    Model 4: Random forest

Although I make some submodels  they are all small adjustments of the model above. 

The data comes from kaggle (link below)

It is one of the most popular data science competitions (if not the most popular) and is a great place for beggingners in data science to start and extend your techniques as you improve. 

This was also my first foray into feature engineering from which I found inspiration from various members of the Kaggle community, I encourage you to take a look into their insights.
